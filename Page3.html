    <h2>Skill1: Create different sizes of titles using Markdown</h2>
    <p>Title is one of the most commonly used content of a note. Title mainly has a variety of formats, 
      so the number of <strong>#</strong> signs is used to distinguish the type of the title. There are six different sizes 
      of headings.</p> 
    <p># Level1 Heading</p>
    <p>## Level2 Heading</p>
    <p>### Level3 Heading</p>
    <p>#### Level4 Heading</p>
    <p>##### Level5 Heading</p>
    <p>###### Level6 Heading</p>

    <p>The effect is as follows:</p>

    <p>The Middle Age Guilds:The Guilds of Florence were secular corporations that controlled the arts and trades in Florence from the twelfth into the sixteenth century. 
    These Arti included seven major guilds, five middle guilds and nine minor guilds .Their rigorous quality control and the political role in the commune that the 
    Art Maggiori assumed were formative influences in the history of Florence, which became one of the richest cities of late Medieval Europe.</p>
    Picture from the website:

    <p>Craftsman Tradition: The guilds, medieval institutions that organized every aspect of a city's economic life, formed a social network that complemented and in part 
      compensated for family ties, although in Florence the welfare side of the guilds' activities was less than in many cities.</p>

    <p>Jack just typed down some notes for the course Western Design History in Markdown. He now wants to distinguish the titles with the content, and he decided to use 
      a Level3 Heading for the subtitles. Which of the following characters should him do to " The Renaissance"?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>### The Renaissance</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>###The Renaissance</p>

    <h2>Skill2: Create Different text highlights using Markdown</h2>
    <p>Highlighting some texts is quite common for people when taking notes.
      The usage in Markdown language is quite simple:  <strong>**</strong> <strong>or -- stands for bold,  * or - stands for italic, ~~ stands for delete.</strong></p>
    <p>**bold** or __bold__</p>
    <p>*italic* or _italic_</p>
    <p>~~delete~~</p>
    <p>The effect is as follows:</p>

    <p>It's Jack and his course Western Design History again. This time, he wants to editor the paragraph "Craftsman Tradition: The guilds, medieval institutions that 
    organized every aspect of a city's economic life, formed a social network that complemented and in part compensated for family ties, although in Florence the 
    welfare side of the guilds' activities was less than in many cities."</p>
    <p>Which of the following is  WRONG if he decides to make the begginning "Craftsman Tradition" bold?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>A. **bold**</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>B. __bold__</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>C. --bold--</p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Skill3: Create Split Line using Markdown</h2>
    <p>Have you ever used <strong>spliting line</strong> to devide sections?</p>
    <p>The syntax of the spliting line only requires three * signs, which is</p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p>And the effect is</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>C. ***</p>

    <h2>Skill4: Insert Pictures and Links using Markdown</h2>
    <p>Pictures and links are also indispensable in taking notes!</p>
    <p>The syntax of inserting pictures and links are quite similar, the only difference is the "!". The formats of these two are as follows.</p>
    <p>Pictures：![]()    ![Text of the picture(optional)](Address of the picture)</p>
    <p>Links：[]()     [Text of the link](Address of the link)</p>
    <p>And links are divided into inline links, referential links and automatic links. </p>
    <p>Inline Link：[Hazel's website](http://www.hazeland.xyz)
    Referential Link：[Hazel's website][url]，the url is a link mark, which can be placed anywhere in the text.  
    [url]:http://www.hazeland.xyz
    The format of the link tag is: [link tag text]: link address  link title (optional)
    Automatic link( which is enclosed with `<>`): <http://www.littlejoyo.cn>
    Picture:
    ![Me](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f2/20/b6/f220b6f46c57ac6583e091597f53a7e1.jpg)</p>
